This is the code repository for [Hands-On Unsupervised Learning with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-unsupervised-learning-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789348279), published by Packt.

**Implement machine learning and deep learning models using Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and more**

## What is this book about?
Unsupervised learning is about making use of raw, untagged data and applying learning algorithms to it to help a machine predict its outcome. With this book, you will explore the concept of unsupervised learning to cluster large sets of data and analyze them repeatedly until the desired outcome is found using Python.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Use cluster algorithms to identify and optimize natural groups of data 
* Explore advanced non-linear and hierarchical clustering in action
* Soft label assignments for fuzzy c-means and Gaussian mixture models
* Detect anomalies through density estimation
* Perform principal component analysis using neural network models

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
X_train = faces['images']
X_train = (2.0 * X_train) - 1.0

width = X_train.shape[1]
height = X_train.shape[2]
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is intended for statisticians, data scientists, machine learning developers, and deep learning practitioners who want to build smart applications by implementing key building block unsupervised learning, and master all the new techniques and algorithms offered in machine learning and deep learning using real-world examples. Some prior knowledge of machine learning concepts and statistics is desirable.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-09).
